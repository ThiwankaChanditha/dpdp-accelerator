import { expect, type Locator, type Page } from '@playwright/test'

/**
 * Fills a filter's text input and submits it, then waits for the URL to actually carry the value.
 *
 * Every filtered list page (SubscriptionsPage.tsx, TopicsPage.tsx, EventsPage.tsx, both consent
 * registries) renders its filter bar with `key={searchParams.toString()}`, and the filter component
 * seeds its own input from `useState(filters.<field>)`. So each committed submit REMOUNTS the whole
 * filter bar and resets every input back to whatever the URL says. A `fill()` that lands in the
 * window between a previous submit and its remount is silently discarded, and the submit that
 * follows sends the OLD term - the list then looks filtered, just by the wrong value.
 *
 * Asserting on the resulting rows does not close that window: the row a test is looking for is
 * usually in the unfiltered list too, so the assertion passes instantly against stale content. The
 * URL is the only signal that the submit really committed - and because the remount key IS the
 * query string, it is also the only way to know the remount is done.
 *
 * So the whole interaction retries as a unit: fill, re-read the input to catch a remount that wiped
 * it, submit, and require the URL to carry the value. Re-filling is harmless - a committed submit
 * leaves the input holding exactly this value anyway. Always route a fill-then-submit filter
 * interaction through this.
